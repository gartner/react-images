react-transition-group
can emit errors of: findDOMNode was passed an instance of Transition which is inside StrictMode.

This can be fixed here, see: https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/releases/tag/v4.4.0

##Switch to framer-motion
react-view-pager (used in Carousel.js) is old and unmaintained. Switch to use framer-motion instead.
